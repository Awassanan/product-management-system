# My Inventory Web Application
This is my inventory web application created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap Framework. It allows users to view all products, add new products, update existing products, and delete products. This project is part of Dev Init #2 by borntoDev, aiming to create a product management system using Node.js and Express.

## Features
- View all products in a table (GET: "/products").
- Add a new product by clicking the button and inputting data via the modal (POST: "/products").
- Update a selected product by clicking the pencil icon and inputting data via the modal (PUT: "/products/:id").
- Delete a selected product by clicking the trash icon (DELETE: "/products/:id").
- Search for a product by its ID (GET: "/products/:id").
